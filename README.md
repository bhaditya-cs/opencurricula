## The Problem
Many teachers around the world don't have great access to teaching good, well developed materials. Too often, teachers are forced to reinvent the wheel - spending countless hours creating content from scratch or relying on incomplete resources. 

Open Curricula was created to address this challenge directly by giving teachers a dedicated platform to share, discover, and collaborate on teaching materials.
## Our solution
Open Curricula solves this issues by creating a platform for educators, where they can:

- Share Curriculum: Upload lesson plans, projects, syllabi, and teaching resources.
- Discover Resources: Browse and search for high-quality & peer reviewed material

## Run Locally
The front end can be easily run by running `npm run dev` in the root directory.

## Technologies and Libraries used
### Front end
The front end uses React, Next.js, and Tailwind to create a modern, professional website that has server side rendering and abilities to work with our backend APIs.

### Backend

The backend uses spring boot to handle API requests and act as a layer between the frontend and server, allowing to easily and securely store and get curricula from the database. Additionally, hibernate acts as our main library for database operations.
